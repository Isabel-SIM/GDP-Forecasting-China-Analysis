# China GDP Forecasting Models

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for forecasting China's GDP using various time series methods. The primary forecasting techniques implemented are:

- Naïve Method
- Seasonal Naive Method
- Holt-Winters Method

The notebook loads GDP data, prepares it for analysis, and generates forecasts while evaluating the accuracy of each method.

## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary components using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage

- Data Preparation: Place your GDP data CSV file (named CHINAGDP.csv) in the same directory as the script. The CSV file should have a column labeled DATE and another labeled CHNGDPNQDSMEI.
- Run the Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook in your terminal
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- Navigate to and open the China_GDP_Forecasting.ipynb file.
- Run all cells in the notebook to generate forecasts and view results

## Forecasting Methods

# Naïve Method:
The Naïve Method forecasts future values based on the last observed value. It serves as a baseline model for comparison.

# Seasonal Naive Method:
This method forecasts by repeating the last observed seasonal pattern. It is particularly useful for datasets with strong seasonal components.

# Holt-Winters Method:
A seasonal exponential smoothing technique that accounts for level, trend, and seasonality in the data. This method is suitable for datasets exhibiting growth trends and seasonal fluctuations.


## Results

- After running all cells in the notebook, you will see:
- Forecast accuracy metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE) for each method.
- Plots comparing actual GDP data with forecasts from each method.
- Five-year ahead forecasts generated by each method.
  
## Discussion 

The discussion section provides insights into the performance of each forecasting method based on accuracy metrics and the implications of results in the context of China's economic conditions.
